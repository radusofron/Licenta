# Toyo Travel Companion

Toyo Travel Companion represents my bachelor's degree project. It is an interactive web platform designed to assist travelers in planning their city trips effectively.

The available options regarding a city are:
* to generate travel itineraries based on user's preferences such as number of days and tourist attractions to be visited
* to read the description from Wikipedia
* to view relevant photos from Unsplash
* to examine some statistics (derived from usersâ€™ evaluations)
* to see and sort the reviews written by other users
* to find the latest news
* to check the weather forecast

Also, the user can see some statistics about their travel activity.
